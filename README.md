# Haunter COD RGH Class Tool

**Why is it unfinished ?** I have shifted my focus to other projects. The tool is functional for the titles listed below, but I am no longer providing updates.

---

| Game | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **COD4 / WaW / MW2 / MW3 / BO1** | ✅ | Fully functional. |
| **Ghosts / Advanced Warfare** | 🏗️ | **Backend complete.** Only needs Frontend implementation. |
| **BO2 / BO3** | ❌ | Not supported. |

**IDs:** You can find all game-specific identifiers in the `IDS/` folder.
